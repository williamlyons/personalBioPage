        <h3> Early Life</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>I was born in Southborough a small town in Massachusetts. 
        I have two brothers and a sister, all of whom are younger than I. I attended kindergarden at Finn school in my town.
        After kindergarden I spent eight years attending the Fay School, where I found that I had a passion for the sciences.
        During my eigthth grade science fair I created a small emp device out of capacitors, copper wiring, and a car battery.
        My teachers assumed that it wouldn't work,
        boy were they proved wrong when I flipped the switch and knocked three nearby computers out of action </p>

        <h3>High School</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>My father worked at a small boarding school in Southborough and through him I was granted a full scholarship
        I attended <a href="http://www.stmarksschool.org/">St. Marks School</a> for four years. St. Marks took a holistic 
        approach to education and consequently I was enrolled in a large variety of classes up until my senior year where
        i was able to specialize a little more. I enrolled in a STEM fellowship and began to study plant biology, specifically
        how the addition of certain phytohormones effected root growth in vetiver grass. My passion for bio-chemistry pushed me
        to apply ED to Washington University in St. Louis due to its stellar reputation in the sciences.</p>

        <h3>College</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>I was accepted into Washington University in 2013 and arrived in august 2014. I was initially enrolled in several
        sciences, such as general chemistry. I qucikly realized that I despised these large lecture courses and that a pursuing a major
        in these areas was not for me. Second semester I took computer science 131 and loved it. I loved being able to create things on
        my computer and was fascinated by the exploding field of big data. I am now enrolled in several computer science courses
        and I am attempting to get my BS in computer science</p>
